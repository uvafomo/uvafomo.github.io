## Adding new content

We use a static website generator to reduce maintainance. For changing the website, use the files in the `build/` directory, and rerun the script `build_website.py`. Running the script is strictly necessary to see any changes. 

* For adding a new lecture, tutorial or any links for those, edit the file [build/lectures.json](build/lectures.json)
* For adding a new practical, edit the file [build/practicals.json](build/practicals.json)
* For adding a new TA or changing data for those, edit the file [build/TAs.json](build/TAs.json)
