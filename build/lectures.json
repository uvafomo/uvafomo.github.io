Yet, much of their underlying technology is closed. In this lecture we give an overview of large-scale multimodal pre-training methods that appeared in the last few years, that should provide hints on the architecture, model specifics and datasets used by their modern counterparts. A recent trend is mixture-of-expert modelling, this will be covered in a separate lecture later in this course.",
